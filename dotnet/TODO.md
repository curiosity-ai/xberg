# Xberg C# Port — Work Breakdown

Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[-]` out of scope (dropped)

Each format is "done" when the `Xberg.TestRunner` output matches the locally generated
`{filename}-results-rust.json` golden files for its fixtures (documented deviations allowed).
See "Re-syncing after an upstream merge" in `Claude.md` for how to regenerate them.

> **Status (after the August upstream merge, 1821 Rust commits):** measured against goldens
> regenerated from the merged `crates/xberg` over the full 2942-fixture corpus:
> **2276 fixtures (77.4%) match on every hard dimension**; content-parity **81.8% identical,
> 90.5% ≥95%-similar**; 55 fixtures (<80%) are genuine content misses; **2 catastrophes
> (0.1%)**. 396 unit tests.

> refs / inline annotations / page-break accounting, `.msg` PR_HTML binary bodies, the full
> email header set with CRLF normalization, csv table elements, DocSecurity flags,
> character counts as Unicode scalars rather than UTF-8 bytes, and — for PDF — scanned-page
> detection plus serde-faithful float formatting.

> A later pass took 2122 → 2276 and catastrophes 22 → 2. Ordered by what they were worth:
> a file's content now overrules its extension when the two disagree (txt 888/975 → 947,
> which is where the DocTags fixtures lived); attachment text is extracted into the message
> that carries it, embedded messages included (eml 20/43 → 39, msg 4/16 → 14); `app.xml`
> titles are sliced by their heading pairs and pptx chart parts are followed (pptx 0/11 → 10);
> typst's missing branches
> (0/8 → 7); a drawing's name as alt text when it has no description (docx 34/46 → 40);
> whole citation records rather than titles alone, and a Table *element* for djot tables
> (nbib, ris, djot all to full parity); HWP's record tags, whose decimal offsets had been

> plus dropping a second copy of every table that upstream had already removed; and markdown
> math (md 671/775 → 691).
>
> Three of those were latent defects the extension/content change exposed rather than caused:

## Known gaps after the merge

Ordered by corpus impact. Each is a real upstream behaviour the port does not yet reproduce —
not a cosmetic difference.

- [x] **PDF metadata (388 fixtures).** Was 0/388, now 324/388. Two independent causes, both
      fixed: the missing scanned-detection fields (`pdf/scan_detect.rs` is now ported as
      `Internal/Pdf/PdfScanDetect.cs`, fed by a dedicated content-stream pass), and serde's
      float spelling — an integral `f32` is `0.0`, not `0`, so `scanned_confidence` failed
      on every document that is *not* scanned. The remaining 64 are other field differences,
      not yet triaged.
- [ ] **PDF content (389 fixtures, 77 fully matching; plain 114/388, markdown 49/388).**
      The largest remaining area, and upstream landed 127 PDF commits in this window. This is
      extraction *quality*, not a missing feature, and it does not decompose into a few
      systematic fixes — measured, not assumed:
      - Plain-text divergence spreads across **223 distinct first-divergence clusters** for
        274 failing fixtures, i.e. mostly reading-order and whitespace, one document at a time.
      - Markdown/html were pinned far below plain by **heading level** assignment rather than
        heading detection. Porting the sparsity gate, the H1-rescue gates and the level
        inference took markdown 32 → 49 and html 27 → 41 of 388, but moved **no fixture into
        `ok`**: every one of them still fails plain or json, so the heading work only pays off
        once reading order does. Rust's remaining rules are in `pdf/structure/classify.rs` +
        `adapters.rs` — still unported there: `sparse_multi_page_heading_map` (a repeated font
        tier across pages), `has_repeated_sparse_peer_heading_tier`, the changelog
        hierarchy passes, and `promote_title_heading`'s guard. Port a rule at a time and
        measure; guessing costs more than it gains.
      - Tables: of 234 mismatches only **30** are "we found no table at all" (the missing
        ruling-line/bordered-grid tier). The other 204 are cell-segmentation differences.
      A caution learned the hard way: `pdf/structure/text_repair.rs` looks like a free win but
      belongs *only* to documents the structure pipeline assembled. Applying it to the flat
      native-text split as well cost 33 of the 114 matching plain fixtures.
- [x] **DocTags ingestion.** Not a new format after all: upstream types these by content, and
      `*.doctags.txt` reached the plain-text extractor only because the port let the extension
      decide. Fixed by the extension/content change; the fixtures now route as markup.
- [ ] **TOML key ordering (toml 1/5).** Rust's `toml::Value::Table` is a `BTreeMap`, so keys
      are emitted in sorted order; the C# parser preserves file order. Datetimes also need the
      `$__toml_private_datetime` wrapper that toml→serde_json produces, while the flattened
      view keeps them plain.
- [x] **pptx metadata (was 0/11, now 11/11).** Not slide numbering: `app.xml`'s `TitlesOfParts`
      is one flat vector concatenating fonts, theme and slide titles, and `HeadingPairs` says
      how many entries each group owns. Taking it whole put the font list in every
      presentation's slide titles. Chart and SmartArt frames are followed now too.
- [ ] **Reviewer comments (`CommentRef` / `CommentDefinition`).** Upstream gave docx comments
      their own element kinds (GH#300). The C# `ElementKindTag` has no such variants, so the
      JSON renderer's comment arms could not be ported with the rest.
- [x] **Email attachment text.** Attachments now go back through the pipeline and contribute a
      level-2 heading plus their text (eml 20/43 → 39, msg 4/16 → 14). Images are deliberately
      excluded: what this port recovers from one is EXIF, which belongs to the attachment's own
      metadata rather than the message body.
- [x] **Embedded message attachments (`afEmbeddedMessage`).** Such an attachment has no binary
      stream — the message is a storage to descend into — so reading only the data stream gave a
      zero-byte attachment and no text. Two further defects surfaced with it: a message's own
      recipients and attachments were gathered by walking the whole container, so an outer
      message claimed the inner one's as well; and the property-stream header is 24 bytes for an
      embedded message where it is 32 at the top level and 8 for an attachment storage, three
      sizes the port had collapsed into two. msg 4/16 → 14/16, the last failure being PDF text
      quality inside an attachment rather than anything about email.
- [x] **Markdown math (md 671/775 → 691).** Inline `$…$` keeps its delimiters in the text;
      display `$$…$$` becomes a Formula element with them stripped. The delimiter rules are
      pulldown-cmark's, read from its source rather than guessed: a run of one `$` is inline and
      two is display, an opening delimiter must not be followed by whitespace (so a price in
      prose cannot open a span), an inline span closes on a `$` not preceded by whitespace, and
      a display span closes only on another `$$`. Not ported: the brace-context rule that lets
      `$}$` stay literal.
- [x] **Citation formats (nbib, ris).** Both at full parity. The parsers were fine; the element
      carried only the title, so everything else was parsed and then dropped.
- [~] **html 10/41 → 27/41.** Two defects, both shared-algorithm rather than HTML-specific.
      Cells were placed by advancing through each row on its own, which ignores the columns a
      rowspan from an earlier row still covers and slides everything beneath one leftwards out
      from under its header; upstream keeps the placement rule in one place (`grid_flatten.rs`)
      so the geometry cannot drift between formats, and this port now does too. And every table
      was recorded twice — a second, unreferenced copy that upstream deliberately removed,
      because it came from the same conversion pass as the first.

      What remains is loose text: the walker discards text that is not inside a `<p>`, so
      `<div>Hello</div>` extracts to nothing. That is also why the two
      `ground_truth/fictionbook/*.md` fixtures (raw `<div>` at the top, so HTML by content) are
      empty — the last two catastrophes. Emitting it unconditionally was tried and is *not* the
      answer: it fixes those two and costs twelve others (plain 22/41 → 10/41). Whatever the
      rule is, it is narrower than "always emit".
- [ ] **odp, ipynb, mdx.** Not yet triaged; use `--cluster`. For ipynb the divergence is
      visible immediately: we emit `[cell_id: …]` and `execution_count: …` as paragraphs and
      skip cell outputs, neither of which upstream does.
- [x] **typ 0/8 → 7/8.** Five separate missing branches; the last fixture needs `@label`
      reference resolution, which is a feature rather than a fix.

---

## Phase 0 — Setup & reference data

- [x] Analyze the Rust repo; identify the content-extraction subset.
- [x] Write `dotnet/Claude.md` (architecture + mapping).
- [x] Create the `dotnet/` solution: `Xberg` (lib), `Xberg.Tests`, `Xberg.TestRunner` (CLI).
- [x] Write the Rust golden-reference generator (`tools/xberg-reference-gen`).
- [x] Run the generator over `../test_documents` to produce the `*-results-rust.json`
      goldens (generated locally, not committed — see `Claude.md`).
- [x] Wire `Xberg.TestRunner` to load fixtures + golden files and diff per format.

## Phase 1 — Core spine (foundational; everything depends on it)

- [x] `Types/`: `InternalDocument`, `InternalElement`, `ElementKind` (tagged union),
      `InternalElementId` (BLAKE3), `Relationship`.
- [x] `Types/`: `Metadata`, `Table`, `BoundingBox`, `ExtractedImage`, `ExtractedUri`,
      `PageContent`, `ExtractedDocument`, `ExtractionResult`, `ProcessingWarning`.
- [x] `Types/`: `DocumentStructure` tree + `NodeContent` + `ContentLayer` + `TextAnnotation`
      (needed for the structured object output).
- [x] `Internal/Blake3`: BLAKE3 hash (must match Rust byte output for element IDs).
- [x] `Core/Config`: trimmed `ExtractionConfig`, `OutputFormat`, `ResultFormat`, per-format
      option structs (native-only).
- [x] `Core/Mime`: extension + magic-byte MIME detection (`detect_mime_type*`), format table.
- [x] `Core/Registry`: extractor registry, dispatch by MIME; `IExtractor` interface.
- [x] `Rendering/Common`: nesting state, `IsBodyElement`, container helpers, `GetLanguage`.
- [x] `Rendering/Plain`.
- [x] `Rendering/Json` (heading-driven tree — port verbatim from `json.rs`).
- [x] `Rendering/Markdown` (GFM). Decide: port comrak AST bridge or direct writer.
- [x] `Rendering/Html` (+ styled variant).
- [x] `Rendering/Djot`.
- [x] `Core/Derive`: `InternalDocument → ExtractedDocument` (native path of `derive.rs`):
      page splitting, structure derivation, language detection (optional), URI collection.
- [x] `Xberg` public API: `Extract(input, config)` sync + async, `ExtractBatch`.

## Phase 2 — Office formats (priority)

- [x] `Internal/Ooxml`: shared OOXML helpers (ZIP open, relationships, shared strings,
      content-types, core/app properties → `Metadata`).
- [x] **docx** (`extractors/docx.rs`, `extraction/docx/`) — paragraphs, styles, tables,
      lists, hyperlinks, images, headers/footers, tracked changes.
- [x] **xlsx** (`extractors/excel.rs`, `extraction/excel.rs`) — sheets → tables, shared
      strings, number formats. Port needed calamine logic.
- [x] **pptx** (`extractors/pptx.rs`, `extraction/pptx/`) — slides, text frames, tables, notes.
- [x] **odt** (`extractors/odt.rs`) — ODF text.
- [x] **ods** — ODF spreadsheet (via excel/calamine path).
- [x] **doc** (`extractors/doc.rs`, `extraction/doc/`) — legacy Word (CFB + FIB/piece table).
- [x] **ppt** (`extractors/ppt.rs`, `extraction/ppt/`) — legacy PowerPoint (CFB).
- [x] **xls** — legacy Excel (CFB, BIFF) via calamine path.
- [x] **rtf** (`extractors/rtf/`) — RTF control-word parser.
- [x] **epub** (`extractors/epub/`) — ZIP + OPF spine + XHTML.
- [x] `Internal/Cfb`: OLE compound-file reader (shared by doc/ppt/xls/hwp/msg).

## Phase 3 — Structured, markup & data formats

- [x] **html** (`extractors/html.rs`) — HTML→Markdown/structured. Port `html-to-markdown-rs`
      or use AngleSharp + custom writer.
- [x] **xml** (`extractors/xml.rs`), **jats** (`jats/`), **docbook** (`docbook.rs`).
- [x] **markdown** (`extractors/markdown.rs`) + **mdx** (`mdx.rs`) + **djot** (`djot_format/`).
- [x] **csv** (`extractors/csv.rs`) — delimiter sniffing → table.
- [x] **structured** (`extractors/structured.rs`) — JSON / JSONL / YAML / TOML.
- [x] **text** (`extractors/text.rs`) — plain text.
- [x] **opml** (`opml/`), **bibtex** (`bibtex.rs`), **citation** (`citation.rs`).
- [x] **rst** (`rst.rs`), **latex** (`latex/`), **org** (`orgmode.rs`), **typst** (`typst.rs`),
      **jupyter** (`jupyter.rs`), **fictionbook** (`fictionbook.rs`), **dbf** (`dbf.rs`).

## Phase 4 — Email & archives

- [x] **eml** + **msg** (`extractors/email.rs`, `extraction/email.rs`) — MIME + CFB msg.
      Attachment-text inlining still missing; see "Known gaps".
- [ ] **pst** (`extractors/pst.rs`) — Outlook PST (port `outlook-pst`; large — evaluate).
- [x] **archives** (`extractors/archive.rs`) — zip / tar / 7z / gzip, recursive extraction
      of children through the pipeline.
- [x] `Internal/SevenZip` (managed LZMA/LZMA2 + 7z container), `Internal/Tar`; gzip/deflate via BCL.

## Phase 5 — PDF, images, Korean & Apple formats

- [x] **pdf** (`extractors/pdf/`, `pdf/`) — text extraction, tables, annotations, form fields,
      per-page content. **Largest single effort.** Pure-managed PDF reader required.
- [x] **image** (`extractors/image.rs`, `extraction/image*.rs`) — metadata + EXIF only
      (OCR path dropped). Use ImageSharp for decode + dimensions.
- [x] **hwp** (`extractors/hwp.rs`) — CFB-based Hangul.
- [x] **hwpx** (`extractors/hwpx.rs`) — ZIP-based Hangul (port `unhwp`).
- [ ] **iwork** (`extractors/iwork/`) — Pages/Numbers/Keynote (ZIP + snappy + protobuf/IWA).

## Phase 6 — Code files (LOWEST priority)

- [ ] **code** (`extractors/code.rs`) — tree-sitter equivalent for 306 languages.
      **Only after all of Phases 1–5 are ported and green.** Evaluate a managed tree-sitter
      binding vs. a lighter language-detection + fenced-block approach.

## Phase 7 — Layout detection (ML)

Brought into scope after the merge. The Rust build reaches ONNX Runtime through `ort`,
a native library; a portable managed NuGet package cannot, so the model runs on a
hand-written ONNX runtime instead of a binding. See `tools/onnx-parity/README.md`.

- [x] **ONNX model parser.** Hand-written protobuf wire reader plus
      ModelProto/GraphProto/NodeProto/TensorProto/AttributeProto decoding
      (`Internal/Onnx/ProtoReader.cs`, `OnnxModel.cs`). No dependency, no codegen; tensor
      payloads are slices over the model bytes rather than copies.
- [x] **Operator kernels** (`Internal/Onnx/Ops/`) covering both pinned graphs — the 40
      operators RT-DETR uses and the table classifier's set. Vectorised through
      `System.Numerics.Tensors`; convolution lowers to GEMM via im2col with dedicated
      pointwise and depthwise paths, and MatMul uses an axpy-ordered kernel so the inner
      loop is a contiguous fused multiply-add.
- [x] **Graph execution** (`OnnxSession.cs`) with liveness-based release of intermediates,
      which is what keeps RT-DETR's working set bounded.
- [x] **RT-DETR wrapper** (`Internal/Layout/RtDetrModel.cs`) and the layout types ported
      from `layout/types.rs`, including the exact preprocessing contract: bilinear resize to
      an exact 640x640 (aspect ratio *not* preserved), `/255`, no ImageNet normalisation.
- [x] **Layer-by-layer validation** against ONNX Runtime via `tools/onnx-parity` and
      `tools/Xberg.OnnxParity`. Every operator instance matches in isolation; all detections
      above threshold agree in class, confidence and geometry.
- [ ] **Model acquisition** — port `layout/model_manager.rs`: Hugging Face download, on-disk
      cache, SHA-256 verification, atomic publish with rollback.
- [x] **Graph optimisation and buffer reuse.** Decomposed batch-norm folded into convolution
      weights, activations fused into the convolution's output pass, and activation storage
      recycled through a pool with reference counts on the buffer (so `Reshape` views and
      `Identity` aliases keep their memory alive). Both verified to produce byte-identical
      detections.
- [ ] **Inference performance.** ~0.95 s per 640x640 page on 4 cores against ONNX Runtime's
      ~0.51 s measured in the same session — roughly 1.8x, down from 16x. The matrix multiply
      is structured after MLAS (packed cache-line-aligned operand panels, a twelve-row AVX-512
      register block whose accumulators stay in registers) and convolution is an implicit GEMM
      that never materialises its receptive fields. What moved it, what was measured and
      rejected, and how to measure anything at all on a VM whose host throughput moves by 2x
      between runs, is recorded in `tools/onnx-parity/README.md`.

      The routes still open, in rough order of expected value: a direct convolution for
      small-channel layers, where the nine-fold im2col expansion stops paying for itself;
      in-place unary operators, since the session already knows which values die at each node;
      and a specialised max-pooling path. Past those it is what C# cannot express — prefetch
      hints and hand-scheduled assembly — plus MLAS's per-CPU kernel variants.
- [ ] **Page rasterisation.** The blocker for end-to-end use: layout detection needs a
      rendered page bitmap, and the C# port has no PDF renderer. Until one exists the model
      can only be driven from images supplied by the caller.
- [ ] **Remaining models**: PP-DocLayout-V3, TATR, SLANeXt wired/wireless, PP-LCNet table
      classifier. The runtime already executes the classifier; the others need their own
      pre/postprocessing ported.
- [ ] **Layout-aware reading order** (`extractors/pdf/reading_order.rs`). Note this is
      entirely `#[cfg(feature = "layout-detection")]`, so it is absent from the goldens —
      measuring it needs `xberg-reference-gen` rebuilt with that feature enabled.

## Cross-cutting

- [ ] `Metadata` extraction parity (office core/app props, EXIF, PDF info dict).
- [ ] URI/link collection.
- [ ] Per-page content splitting.
- [ ] Document-structure tree derivation (for the structured object output).
- [ ] Security limits (max size, zip-bomb guards — `extractors/security.rs`).
- [ ] CI: build + run `Xberg.TestRunner` on the fixtures; publish NuGet on tag. Note the
      corpus is no longer self-contained: CI must run `test_documents/scripts/fetch_corpus.py`
      and regenerate goldens, since neither the binaries nor the goldens are in git.
- [ ] Performance: the 55 MB `parsebench/text_content.jsonl` fixture takes ~29s to render
      markdown now that structured formats build an element tree. Not wrong, but far off
      Rust; the harness timeout was raised to 120s to keep it measured rather than skipped.
