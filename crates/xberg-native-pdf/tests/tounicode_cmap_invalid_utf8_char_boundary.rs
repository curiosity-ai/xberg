//! Regression test for a `ToUnicode` CMap char-boundary panic caused by
//! `fonts::cmap`'s lossy UTF-8 decoding of the raw (attacker-controlled)
//! stream.
//!
//! `parse_tounicode_cmap` decodes the raw stream bytes with
//! `String::from_utf8_lossy`, which substitutes each invalid byte sequence
//! with the 3-byte U+FFFD replacement character. The capture regexes used
//! throughout the module (`<([^>]*)>`) match any character between angle
//! brackets, including U+FFFD, so a captured `dst_hex` can be a mix of
//! 1-byte ASCII characters and one or more 3-byte U+FFFD characters. Several
//! sites then branched on `dst_hex.len()` (a BYTE count) and sliced
//! `dst_hex` at fixed byte offsets, which panics with "byte index N is not a
//! char boundary" whenever a U+FFFD straddles the offset.
//!
//! Of the sites originally suspected, only two are actually reachable with
//! corrupted input:
//! - `parse_bfchar_line`'s `step_by(4)` loop (its final, longer-than-8-bytes
//!   branch), which slices `&dst_hex[i..end]` directly, with no upstream
//!   validation.
//! - `parse_bfrange_line`'s array-form counterpart, the same `step_by(4)`
//!   shape over each array entry.
//!
//! The `dst_hex.len() == 8` branch in both functions (the UTF-16 surrogate
//! pair / two-BMP-char split) is NOT reachable this way, even though it also
//! slices `&dst_hex[0..4]` / `&dst_hex[4..8]`: that slicing is nested inside
//! an `else` that only runs after `u32::from_str_radix(&dst_hex, 16)` has
//! already succeeded on the FULL 8-byte string. `from_str_radix` rejects any
//! non-ASCII-hex byte (including every byte of a U+FFFD) as an invalid
//! digit, so a corrupted `dst_hex` is already rejected via `?` before the
//! nested slice is ever reached. This is verified below (see
//! `bfchar_dst_with_invalid_utf8_at_eight_byte_length_is_dropped_without_panic`).
//!
//! The fix validates each captured hex string is pure ASCII hex digits at
//! the capture boundary (`is_ascii_hex_digits` in `fonts::cmap`), before any
//! length check or slice — matching this crate's convention of clamping
//! attacker-controlled input at the parse boundary rather than patching each
//! downstream consumption site (see `tounicode_bfrange_array_range_overflow.rs`
//! for the same convention applied to a different defect in a neighboring
//! function). A malformed capture is now rejected the same way any other
//! malformed hex already was: the entry is dropped and a `tracing::warn!`
//! fires, degrading gracefully instead of panicking.
