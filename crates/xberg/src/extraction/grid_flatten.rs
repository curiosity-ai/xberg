//! Span-aware flattening of table grids to `Vec<Vec<String>>`.
//!
//! Several extractors (HTML, DOCX, PPTX, email) receive tables as a stream of
//! cells carrying `row_span` / `col_span`. Flattening them by trusting a naive
//! per-row column index shifts every cell under a `rowspan` left into the
//! spanning column, misaligning the data against its headers
//! (xberg-io/xberg#1223). This helper places cells on a grid that reserves the
//! columns still covered by a rowspan started in an earlier row, so merged-cell
//! tables keep their column alignment across every format.
//!
//! Both `col_span` and `row_span` are clamped ([`MAX_COL_SPAN`], [`MAX_ROW_SPAN`])
//! before they can size anything. This is deliberately the single choke point for
//! that clamp: `resolve_span_grid` has two callers with different amounts of
//! trust in their input — `html::structure`'s own attribute parser, and
//! `html::converter`, which forwards `col_span`/`row_span` values produced by the
//! vendored `html_to_markdown_rs` crate. That crate clamps spans on its
//! Markdown-rendering path but *not* on the `document_structure`/`TableGrid`
//! path `converter.rs` actually consumes (`types::structure_builder`, as of
//! 3.11.3), so an untrusted `colspan`/`rowspan` can reach here unclamped from
//! upstream even though our own parser is fixed. Clamping here catches both.

/// Upper bound on `colspan` accepted by [`resolve_span_grid`].

/// mangle a legitimate document. It also caps the cost of the occupancy
