//! Regression test: an ODT ZIP member's *declared* uncompressed size is not
//! what actually gets read out of the archive.
//!
//! `ZipBombValidator::validate` (run once at archive open) computes its ratio
//! and size checks entirely from the ZIP central directory's declared
//! `compressed_size`/`uncompressed_size` fields (via `by_index_raw`, which
//! never decompresses anything). Those fields are ordinary attacker-controlled
//! metadata: the `zip` crate's actual read path
//! (`ZipFileData::find_content`, `types.rs` in the `zip` crate) bounds the
//! decompressor's input purely by the central directory's *compressed* size,
//! and nothing in the read path enforces the declared *uncompressed* size at
//! all -- `Crc32Reader` only checks its checksum once the underlying reader
//! reports EOF. So a central directory record can declare a tiny
//! `uncompressed_size` while its real deflate stream expands to far more than
//! that, and `ZipBombValidator` sees only the lie.
//!
//! The fix bounds every ZIP member read with `Read::take(MAX_ODT_MEMBER_SIZE)`
//! at the point the bytes are actually pulled out (`pre_extract_images`,
//! `pre_extract_formulas`, and both `content.xml`/`styles.xml` reads in
//! `crates/xberg/src/extractors/odt.rs`), independent of what the central
//! directory declared. This file proves that mechanism specifically for
//! `pre_extract_images`, whose output (raw, unparsed bytes) can be measured by
//! length exactly: an embedded image's real decompressed size is held fixed at
//! and one byte over `MAX_ODT_MEMBER_SIZE`, while the ZIP central directory is
//! made to lie and declare a 5-byte image. Against unfixed code (`read_to_end`
//! with no `.take()`) the "at cap" test still passes, but the "over cap" test
//! fails: the returned image would be `MAX_ODT_MEMBER_SIZE + 1` bytes long
//! (the full real payload, unbounded) instead of truncated to the cap.
//!
//! Building the crafted archive does not need a raw ZIP-byte hand-assembly
//! like `issue_197_archive_size_accounting_overflow.rs` uses: `zip::ZipWriter`
//! already computes a correct, real `compressed_size` for genuine payload
//! data, so only the central directory's `uncompressed_size` *field* needs to
//! be patched after the fact -- the local file header's own size fields are
//! provably irrelevant to reading (the `zip` crate consults them only to
//! locate where file *data* starts, via file-name/extra-field lengths).
