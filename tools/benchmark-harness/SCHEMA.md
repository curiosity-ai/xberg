# Aggregation Schema v2.9.0

This document describes the structure of `aggregated.json` produced by `benchmark-harness consolidate`.

## Top-level Shape

```json
{
  "schema_version": "2.9.0",
  "by_framework_mode": {
    "<aggregate_key>": {
      /* FrameworkModeAggregation */
    }
  },
  "disk_sizes": {
    "framework": {
      /* DiskSizeInfo */
    }
  },
  "comparison": {
    /* ComparisonData */
  },
  "per_fixture_results": [
    /* PerFixtureRow[] */
  ],
  "metadata": {
    /* ConsolidationMetadata */
  },
  "run_provenance": [
    /* RunProvenanceRecord[] — v2.8.0+, see "Migration from v2.7.0 to v2.8.0" */
  ],
  "failure_summary": {
    /* FailureSummary — v2.9.0+, see "FailureSummary" */
  },
  "format_support": {
    /* FormatSupportMatrix — v2.9.0+, see "FormatSupportMatrix" */
  }
}
```

## Output Format Discriminator

The `output_format` field determines:

- **`markdown`**: Supports all metrics including SF1 (structural F1), layout percentiles, and all ranking tables
- **`plaintext`**: Text-only extraction; SF1 and layout percentiles are `null`; plaintext frameworks never appear in SF1 rankings

## by_framework_mode

Key format differs by framework family:

- **xberg** (`xberg-*`): `{framework_name}:{mode}` — the output format is already encoded
  in the framework name (e.g. `xberg-markdown-baseline`), so repeating it in the key is
  redundant.
- **competitors** (all other frameworks): `{framework}:{output_format}:{mode}` — format is not
  encoded in the name, so the key carries it explicitly.

Examples:

- `xberg-markdown-baseline:single`
- `xberg-plaintext-paddle-ocr:batch`
- `unstructured:plaintext:single`
- `docling:markdown:single`

Each entry contains:

```json
{
  "framework": "string", // Framework name without mode suffix
  "output_format": "markdown|plaintext", // Output format used
  "mode": "single|batch|...", // Execution mode
  "cold_start": {
    /* DurationPercentiles */
  }, // Optional, if cold start data available
  "by_file_type": {
    "pdf": {
      "file_type": "pdf",
      "no_ocr": {
        /* PerformancePercentiles */
      },
      "with_ocr": {
        /* PerformancePercentiles */
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## PerformancePercentiles

Contains p50, p95, p99 for all metrics — see "Percentiles" immediately below for the p95/p99
suppression and dispersion contract (v2.10.0+):

```json
{
  "successful_sample_count": 42,
  "performance_sample_count": 40, // process-level samples used for duration/throughput/memory/cpu_seconds (v2.7.0+); a native batch contributes one regardless of document cardinality
  "total_sample_count": 50,
  "framework_errors": 0,
  "harness_errors": 5,
  "timeouts": 3,
  "empty_content": 0,       // framework produced no content at all
  "zero_overlap": 0,        // framework produced non-empty output with zero token overlap vs a non-empty ground truth
  "error_details": {
    "error message": 2
  },
  "duration": { "p50": 100.5, "p95": 150.2, "p99": null, "sample_count": 40, "std_dev": 22.1 },
  "throughput": { "p50": 5.2, "p95": 4.8, "p99": 3.1, "sample_count": 40, "std_dev": 0.9 },
  "memory": { "p50": 150.0, "p95": 200.0, "p99": 250.0, "sample_count": 40, "std_dev": 18.4 },
  "extraction_duration": { "p50": 80.0, "p95": 120.0, "p99": 160.0, "sample_count": 40, "std_dev": 12.0 }, // Optional
  "quality": {
    /* QualityPercentiles */
  }, // Optional, if quality data available
  "success_rate_percent": 84.0,
  "pages_per_sec": { "p50": 12.5, "p95": 8.0, "p99": 5.0, "sample_count": 40, "std_dev": 1.1 }, // Optional (v2.7.0+, PDF only)
  "cpu_seconds": { "p50": 1.2, "p95": 2.1, "p99": 3.4, "sample_count": 38, "std_dev": 0.6 }, // v2.7.0+
  "batch_size": 8, // Optional (v2.7.0+; derived from real batch membership since v2.10.0+, see Migration)
  "system_load": {
    /* SystemLoadPercentiles */
  }, // Optional (v2.7.0+)
  "throughput_excluded_sample_count": 0 // v2.8.0+
}
```

## Percentiles (v2.10.0+ contract)

Each metric (`duration`, `throughput`, `memory`, `extraction_duration`, `pages_per_sec`,
`cpu_seconds`) is a `Percentiles` object:

```json
{ "p50": 100.5, "p95": 150.2, "p99": null, "sample_count": 40, "std_dev": 22.1 }
```

- **`p50`**: always reported (`0.0` when `sample_count == 0`).
- **`p95`**: `null` when `sample_count < 20` (`MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_P95`).
- **`p99`**: `null` when `sample_count < 100` (`MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_P99`).
- **`sample_count`**: how many values this group was computed from.
- **`std_dev`**: sample standard deviation (Bessel-corrected) of the underlying values; `0.0` for
  `sample_count <= 1`.

R-7 interpolation places a percentile at index `p * (sample_count - 1)`. Below roughly
`1 / (1 - p)` samples that index coincides with (or sits immediately next to) the maximum observed
value, so the "percentile" is really just the largest sample or two wearing a statistical label —
real benchmark cohorts are frequently 4-8 fixtures, well under either threshold. `p95`/`p99` are
`null` in that case instead of a fabricated number that looks precise but isn't, and `sample_count`
/`std_dev` are always present so a reader can judge the underlying distribution regardless (see
"Migration from v2.9.0 to v2.10.0").

## QualityPercentiles

Includes p50, p95, p99 for all F1 metrics. Layout percentiles are `null` for plaintext-only frameworks:

```json
{
  "f1_text_p50": 0.92,
  "f1_text_p95": 0.88,
  "f1_text_p99": 0.75,
  "f1_numeric_p50": 0.85,
  "f1_numeric_p95": 0.8,
  "f1_numeric_p99": 0.7,
  "f1_layout_p50": 0.78, // null for plaintext output format
  "f1_layout_p95": 0.72, // null for plaintext output format
  "f1_layout_p99": 0.65, // null for plaintext output format
  "quality_score_p50": 0.85,
  "quality_score_p95": 0.8,
  "quality_score_p99": 0.7
}
```

## SystemLoadPercentiles (v2.7.0+)

A contention qualifier aggregated from `BenchmarkResult.system_load` snapshots in the group.
`null` when no result in the group carries a snapshot. See the "Tier A comparative performance
metrics" migration notes below for how to read `load_per_core`.

```json
{
  "load_per_core_p50": 0.35,
  "load_per_core_p95": 0.9,
  "contended_sample_count": 3,
  "total_sample_count": 20
}
```

## PerFixtureRow

One row per unique combination of (framework, output_format, execution_mode, fixture_id, ocr).
The batch dedup that collapses a native batch to one `performance_sample_count` in
`PerformancePercentiles` does **not** apply here: every per-document row from a batch is present
(see "Migration from v2.7.0 to v2.8.0").

```json
{
  "framework": "xberg-markdown-baseline",
  "output_format": "markdown",
  "execution_mode": "single",
  "ocr": false,
  "fixture_id": "sample_doc_1",
  "file_type": "pdf",
  "duration_ms": 125.4,
  "peak_memory_mb": 180.5,
  "f1_text": 0.92,
  "f1_layout": 0.78, // null for plaintext mode
  "f1_numeric": 0.85,
  "quality_score": 0.85,
  "correct": true,
  "success": true,
  "error_kind": null, // "FrameworkError", "HarnessError", "Timeout", "EmptyContent", "ZeroOverlap", etc. if !success
  "file_size": 45210, // v2.8.0+
  "throughput_bytes_per_sec": 361280.5, // v2.8.0+
  "avg_cpu_percent": 42.1, // v2.8.0+
  "cpu_seconds": 0.31, // v2.8.0+
  "baseline_memory_bytes": 12582912, // v2.8.0+
  "peak_memory_delta_bytes": 176160768, // v2.8.0+
  "p50_memory_bytes": 150000000, // v2.8.0+, this single measurement's own sampler percentile
  "p95_memory_bytes": 175000000, // v2.8.0+
  "p99_memory_bytes": 189000000, // v2.8.0+
  "extraction_duration_ms": 98.0, // Optional, v2.8.0+
  "subprocess_overhead_ms": 27.4, // Optional, v2.8.0+
  "cold_start_duration_ms": 210.0, // Optional, v2.8.0+
  "error_message": null, // Optional free-text error, v2.8.0+
  "quality": {
    /* QualityMetrics, including missing_tokens/extra_tokens — Optional, v2.8.0+ */
  },
  "pdf_metadata": {
    /* PdfMetadata — Optional, v2.8.0+ */
  },
  "framework_capabilities": {
    /* FrameworkCapabilities, including batch_capability — v2.8.0+ */
  },
  "system_load": {
    /* SystemLoad — Optional, v2.8.0+ */
  },
  "iterations": [
    /* IterationResult[] — v2.8.0+, empty unless multiple iterations were run */
  ],
  "statistics": {
    /* DurationStatistics — Optional, v2.8.0+ */
  }
}
```

`ocr` is `true` or `false` only when actual OCR usage is known. It is `null` when the framework did not report OCR usage.

The `duration_ms`/`peak_memory_mb`/`f1_*`/`quality_score`/`correct` fields are the original
v2.3.0 convenience projection and remain unchanged. The v2.8.0 fields above make each row
losslessly carry every measured field from its source `BenchmarkResult` — including ones with no
earlier scalar equivalent, like the free-text `error_message` or the token-level
`quality.missing_tokens`/`extra_tokens` lists.

## FailureSummary (v2.9.0+)

Top-level `failure_summary` rolls the per-framework-mode error counts (which also live on each
[`PerformancePercentiles`](#performancepercentiles)) up to the cohort level, preserving the
framework-fault vs infrastructure split throughout:

```json
{
  "total": { /* FailureCounts */ },
  "by_framework_mode": { "<aggregate_key>": { /* FailureCounts */ } },
  "by_file_type": { "docx": { /* FailureCounts */ } }
}
```

Each `FailureCounts` object:

```json
{
  "framework_errors": 0,     // framework hit a hard error on a supported document
  "empty_content": 0,        // framework produced no content at all for a supported document
  "zero_overlap": 0,         // framework produced non-empty output with zero token overlap vs a non-empty ground truth
  "timeouts": 0,             // framework exceeded the timeout on a supported document
  "framework_fault_total": 0, // sum of the four above; these penalize quality + success rate
  "harness_errors": 0,       // our harness failed (process crash, bad JSON): never penalizes
  "config_setup_errors": 0,  // our config/setup failed (missing deps): never penalizes
  "infra_total": 0           // sum of the two infrastructure kinds above
}
```

Framework-fault failures are the framework's own fault — it was handed a document in a format it
declares support for and failed — and are scored as quality 0 in the percentiles. Infrastructure
failures are our harness's fault and are excluded from both the quality percentiles and the
success-rate denominator. `total` counts every document; `by_framework_mode` and `by_file_type`
partition the same failures by aggregate key and by file extension respectively.

`empty_content` and `zero_overlap` are both framework-fault failures but mean different things:
`empty_content` is a framework that produced no content at all (set directly by the adapter that
ran it); `zero_overlap` is a framework that produced non-empty output that shares zero tokens with
a non-empty ground truth (set by the runner's post-scoring reclassification — see "Zero-overlap
reclassification" below). Both are excluded from quality percentiles and both still contribute
their duration/throughput/memory/cpu_seconds/pages_per_sec measurements to `PerformancePercentiles`
— see "Timing eligibility" below.

### Zero-overlap reclassification

A result that reports `success = true` / `error_kind = None` but whose text quality score
(`f1_score_text`) is `0.0` against a non-empty ground truth is not a legitimate "perfect failure"
quality sample — it is non-empty garbage output masquerading as a successful extraction. The runner
reclassifies it to `success = false` / `error_kind = "ZeroOverlap"` before aggregation so it is
excluded from quality percentiles/rankings but still counted against coverage/success-rate stats,
exactly like any other framework-fault failure. Fixtures with an empty (post-trim) ground truth are
never reclassified this way, since there is no signal to score against.

### Timing eligibility

`PerformancePercentiles.duration/throughput/memory/cpu_seconds/pages_per_sec` and
`performance_sample_count` are computed over *timing-eligible* results, not strictly successful
ones: a result is timing-eligible if `success == true`, or if it was reclassified to
`error_kind == "ZeroOverlap"`. In both cases the framework actually ran to completion and produced
output within the measured window, so the timing measurement is valid even though the *quality* is
disqualified. Excluding zero-overlap results from timing (as if gated on raw `success`) would bias
every framework's speed percentiles: a competitor that returns fast garbage on unsupported/degraded
input would have its fastest samples silently dropped, inflating its measured duration and
depressing its measured throughput relative to a framework that rarely produces zero-overlap
output. `ErrorKind::EmptyContent` results remain excluded from timing, unchanged from prior
behavior — a framework that produced literally nothing has no meaningful timing sample to
contribute.

## FormatSupportMatrix (v2.9.0+)

Top-level `format_support` distinguishes formats a framework declares unsupported from formats it
attempted and failed. It uses the same capability table that filters fixtures before execution.

```json
{
  "file_types": ["docx", "pdf", "rtf"],
  "unsupported": {
    "docling": ["rtf"],
    "liteparse": ["docx", "rtf"]
  }
}
```

`file_types` is the sorted set observed anywhere in the consolidated results. Release aggregates
include xberg's full-corpus run, so this is the complete corpus format set there. A competitor-only
aggregate cannot list a format that produced no result for any selected framework. `unsupported`
maps each logical framework to observed file types absent from its declared capabilities; xberg is
never listed because it is the full-corpus subject under test. Both fields default empty when older
v2.9.0 aggregates are deserialized.

## Migration from v2.9.0 to v2.10.0

Additive only — no key-format change, no field removed or renamed. Fixes four statistical-integrity
defects where a published number looked like a real measurement but was actually a harness
artifact (tiny-n interpolation, a monitoring-resolution floor, a coarse ratio, or a silent
disappearance).

- **`Percentiles.p95`/`Percentiles.p99`** (nullable, was always-present `f64`; new
  **`sample_count`** and **`std_dev`** fields): `p95` is `null` when the underlying sample count is
  below `MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_P95` (20); `p99` is `null` below `MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_P99` (100). Real
  benchmark cohorts are frequently 4-8 fixtures, at which R-7 interpolation for p95/p99 was
  effectively just reading off the maximum sample rather than a genuine tail percentile — a single
  outlier document silently became "the p99 tail." `sample_count` and `std_dev` are always present
  so a reader can judge the underlying distribution's size and dispersion even when p95/p99 are
  suppressed, and so a `0.0` `p50` on a degenerate (empty) group is distinguishable from a real
  `0.0` measurement. This is a **breaking change for consumers that read `p95`/`p99` as a bare
  number** — they must now handle `null`. See "Percentiles (v2.10.0+ contract)" above.
- **`PerformancePercentiles.cpu_seconds`**: a `cpu_seconds` reading of exactly `0.0` is now treated
  as "below measurement resolution" (the process ran with fewer than 2 resource-sampler ticks — see
  `integrate_cpu_core_seconds` in `monitoring.rs`), not a real "zero CPU-seconds consumed"
  measurement (physically impossible for a process that ran to completion). Such readings are
  excluded from the `cpu_seconds` distribution entirely, so `cpu_seconds.sample_count` can be lower
  than `performance_sample_count` for a framework whose runs are frequently too fast to sample.
- **`PerformancePercentiles.batch_size`**: now derived from real batch membership
  (`framework_capabilities.batch_sample_id`) instead of the coarse `total_sample_count /
  performance_sample_count` ratio. That ratio was only correct when every eligible row was its own
  batch of one; once some rows were excluded from timing eligibility for a reason unrelated to
  batch grouping (e.g. `EmptyContent`), it silently reported the inverse timing-eligibility rate
  instead of a document count — 10 single-file results with 5 timing-eligible used to publish a
  fictitious `batch_size` of 2. Single-file mode now always reports `Some(1)`.
- **`ComparisonData.unranked_frameworks`** (`UnrankedFramework[]`, new, defaults to `[]`): records
  every framework attempted but excluded from a ranking, with why — see "UnrankedFramework
  (v2.10.0+)" above. Covers both the pre-existing "zero performance samples" exclusion (previously
  silent) and the new cpu_seconds-floor exclusion above.
- **`ComparisonData.cpu_seconds_ranking`**: a framework whose every performance sample measured
  `0.0` cpu_seconds is now excluded from this ranking (previously it could win rank 1 with that
  physically impossible value, since ascending sort put `0.0` first) and recorded in
  `unranked_frameworks` instead. The pre-existing smallest-positive-value `reference_cpu_seconds`
  logic for `relative` is unchanged for the frameworks that remain.

## Migration from v2.7.0 to v2.8.0

Additive only — no key-format change, no field removed or renamed. Motivated by an aggregation
audit that found several measured fields from `results.json` (and the entire `provenance.json`
sidecar) were silently dropped during consolidation.

- **`run_provenance`** (`RunProvenanceRecord[]`, top-level, new): one entry per input directory
  the `consolidate` command read from, folding in the `provenance.json` sidecar that
  `load_run_results` previously ignored entirely. `aggregate_new_format` itself always leaves
  this empty (it has no filesystem access); the `consolidate` CLI command populates it. Shape:

  ```json
  {
    "source_dir": "xberg-markdown-baseline-batch",
    "provenance": {
      /* RunProvenance — see "Run provenance sidecar" below — or null */
    },
    "missing_reason": "provenance.json not found in ..." // Present only when provenance is null
  }
  ```

  A missing `provenance.json` is recorded, not treated as an error — see
  `consolidate::load_run_provenance`.
- **`PerFixtureRow`**: extended with `file_size`, `throughput_bytes_per_sec`, `avg_cpu_percent`,
  `cpu_seconds`, `baseline_memory_bytes`, `peak_memory_delta_bytes`, `p50/p95/p99_memory_bytes`,
  `extraction_duration_ms`, `subprocess_overhead_ms`, `cold_start_duration_ms`, `error_message`,
  `quality` (the full `QualityMetrics`, including `missing_tokens`/`extra_tokens`),
  `pdf_metadata`, `framework_capabilities` (including `batch_capability`), `system_load`,
  `iterations`, and `statistics`. See the `PerFixtureRow` section above for the full shape.
- **`PerformancePercentiles.throughput_excluded_sample_count`** (`usize`, new): the number of
  successful performance samples excluded from the `throughput` percentiles because their
  throughput was zero, negative, or non-finite. The exclusion rule itself is unchanged from
  pre-v2.8.0 behavior; this field only makes a previously-silent exclusion visible.
- **`ConsolidationMetadata.disk_size_conflicts`** (`string[]`, new, defaults to `[]`): human-
  readable notes for any framework where two or more results reported a different
  `installation_size`. `disk_sizes` has always kept only the last-seen value per framework; this
  field surfaces when that last-writer-wins behavior actually discarded a conflicting value.

## Migration from v2.6.0 to v2.7.0

- The published SF1 (`f1_layout`) now folds in the D6 table cell-content dimension
  (GriTS-Con), weighted `1.5` — equal to table topology. A table with the right grid
  but wrong cell text now scores lower than one with correct content. D6 was already
  computed and reported in prior versions; it is now part of the rollup, so SF1 values
  and PDF rankings shift downward for frameworks that reconstruct grids but garble cells.
  Table-less documents are unaffected (D6 is gated on table presence).

### Tier A comparative performance metrics (additive)

All fields below are additive to the `2.7.0` schema (no version bump, no key-format change).
Consumers built against the fields documented in "Migration from v2.5.0" and earlier remain
compatible: every new field is either optional (`null`/absent when not applicable) or has a
type-appropriate default (`0.0` for numeric percentiles) when deserializing older artifacts that
predate it.

- **`PerformancePercentiles.pages_per_sec`** (optional `Percentiles`): pages-per-second
  percentiles, derived from the harness-side (framework-agnostic) `PdfMetadata.page_count`
  divided by wall-clock duration — never a framework's self-reported page count, so every
  framework is compared against the same ground truth. `null` when no result in the group
  carries a known PDF page count (non-PDF file types, or a PDF the harness could not size). For
  a native batch, the page counts of every document sharing one batch invocation are summed
  before dividing by the batch's shared makespan, mirroring how `throughput` is computed for
  batches from summed bytes rather than a single member row.
- **`PerformancePercentiles.cpu_seconds`** (`Percentiles`, always present): total process-tree
  CPU-time percentiles, in core-seconds. Computed by trapezoidal integration of the resource
  sampler's per-sample CPU percentage over its timeline (see
  `PerformanceMetrics.cpu_seconds` doc comment). **Precision is bounded by the sampling
  interval** (1-10ms, adaptive on file size): CPU bursts shorter than the gap between two
  samples are smoothed by the trapezoidal average rather than measured exactly, so treat
  `cpu_seconds` as an approximation, not an exact accounting figure.
- **`PerformancePercentiles.batch_size`** (optional `usize`): the approximate number of
  documents processed per one measured process invocation in this group — `1` for single-file
  mode, or the modal per-batch document count for a native batch (`total_sample_count /
  performance_sample_count`, rounded). This lets peak-RSS (and any other performance metric
  already in this struct) be read "keyed by batch size" using the single-file-vs-batch mode
  entries the benchmark matrix already runs, without adding a new axis to the
  `by_framework_mode` aggregate key.
- **`PerformancePercentiles.system_load`** (optional `SystemLoadPercentiles`): surfaces the
  previously-captured-but-discarded `BenchmarkResult.system_load` as a contention qualifier —
  `null` when no result in the group carries a snapshot. Read `load_per_core` *relatively* (was
  this bucket measured under comparable contention to another) rather than as an absolute
  number; `contended_sample_count` counts samples whose 1-minute load average per logical core
  exceeded the harness's contention threshold.
- **`ComparisonData.pages_per_sec_ranking`** / **`cpu_seconds_ranking`** (`RankedFramework[]`):
  new rankings mirroring `throughput_ranking` and `memory_ranking` respectively — pages/sec
  ranked descending (higher is better), CPU-seconds ranked ascending (lower is better). Only
  frameworks with at least one pages/sec observation appear in `pages_per_sec_ranking`. Like
  `throughput_ranking` and `memory_ranking`, both are scored within each `(output_format, mode)`
  segment — see the `RankedFramework` section below.
- **`ComparisonData.pareto_frontier`** (`ParetoPoint[]`): the non-dominated frontier over
  (pages/sec ↑, SF1 ↑, peak-RSS ↓) for markdown frameworks that carry both an SF1 term and a
  pages/sec observation (plaintext-only frameworks never carry SF1, so they are never eligible;
  see `ParetoPoint`'s doc comment for the dominance rule). Pure computation over already-reported
  percentiles — no new capture-time data required.

## Migration from v2.5.0 to v2.6.0

- `PerFixtureRow.ocr` changed from a required boolean to a nullable boolean so unknown OCR usage is not mislabeled as `false`.

### UnrankedFramework (v2.10.0+)

A framework present in `by_framework_mode` (it ran) but absent from `throughput_ranking` /
`memory_ranking` / `cpu_seconds_ranking` / `pages_per_sec_ranking` / `pareto_frontier`, because it
had no usable performance sample for that ranking. Every one of those rankings is gated on having
at least one performance sample; before this field existed, a framework whose every result failed
or was reclassified (or whose cpu_seconds measurements all hit the monitoring-resolution floor —
see "Migration from v2.9.0 to v2.10.0") simply vanished from the charts with nothing recording it
was attempted. This makes that absence explicit:

```json
{
  "framework_mode": "docling:markdown:single",
  "reason": "no usable performance samples (12 total result(s), none timing-eligible); excluded from throughput_ranking, memory_ranking, cpu_seconds_ranking, pages_per_sec_ranking, and pareto_frontier"
}
```

A framework can appear once for a total exclusion (as above) or, separately, for a
`cpu_seconds_ranking`-only exclusion when it has usable performance samples for every other
ranking but every one of its cpu_seconds readings was `0.0` (see "Migration from v2.9.0 to
v2.10.0"); `reason` is free text, not a fixed enum, so read it rather than pattern-matching a
specific wording.

### RankedFramework

`throughput_ranking`, `memory_ranking`, `cpu_seconds_ranking`, and `pages_per_sec_ranking` are each
ranked and scored **within** a framework's own `(output_format, mode)` segment, not globally —
`"rank": 1` / `"relative": 1.0` mean "best among frameworks sharing this same output format and
mode," not "best overall." A markdown row pays a serialization cost a plaintext row never incurs,
and a native-batch row amortizes process startup over every document in the batch while a
single-file row pays it once per document — pooling either pair together would rank frameworks on
harness plumbing rather than real performance (mirroring why `quality_ranking_markdown` /
`quality_ranking_plaintext` are already split by format above; see `shared_corpus_markdown` /
`shared_corpus_plaintext` in `ConsolidationMetadata`). `output_format` and `mode` on each entry
self-identify which segment `rank`/`relative` are scoped to.

```json
{
  "framework_mode": "xberg-markdown-baseline:single",
  "rank": 1,
  "value": 95.5, // The metric value (duration, throughput, etc.)
  "relative": 1.0, // Ratio relative to the best value WITHIN this entry's own segment (1.0 = best)
  "output_format": "markdown", // Which segment rank/relative are scoped to (v2.9.0+)
  "mode": "single" // Which segment rank/relative are scoped to, e.g. "single"/"batch" (v2.9.0+)
}
```

### ParetoPoint (v2.7.0+)

One non-dominated point in the (pages/sec, SF1, peak-RSS) multi-objective comparison. A
candidate is on the frontier when no other candidate dominates it: dominance requires being at
least as good on every objective and strictly better on at least one. `pages_per_sec` and `sf1`
are maximized; `peak_memory_mb` is minimized.

```json
{
  "framework_mode": "xberg-markdown-layout:single",
  "pages_per_sec": 12.5,
  "sf1": 0.82,
  "peak_memory_mb": 320.0
}
```

## Migration from v2.3.0 to v2.4.0

### Breaking Changes

1. **Schema version**: Bumped to `"2.4.0"`
2. **Xberg aggregate key format**: Changed from `framework:output_format:mode` to
   `framework_name:mode` for all `xberg-*` frameworks. Competitor key format
   (`framework:output_format:mode`) is unchanged.

### Xberg Consolidation

Language-binding frameworks (`xberg-py`, `xberg-node`, `xberg-rb`, `xberg-go`,
`xberg-java`, `xberg-csharp`, `xberg-elixir`, `xberg-php`, `xberg-rust`, etc.)
have been removed. They are replaced by three native pipelines run directly via the xberg CLI:

| Pipeline  | Markdown name                   | Plaintext name                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Baseline  | `xberg-markdown-baseline`   | `xberg-plaintext-baseline`   |
| Layout    | `xberg-markdown-layout`     | `xberg-plaintext-layout`     |
| PaddleOCR | `xberg-markdown-paddle-ocr` | `xberg-plaintext-paddle-ocr` |

Batch variants append `-batch` to the framework name (e.g. `xberg-markdown-baseline-batch`),
which the harness normalises to aggregate key `xberg-markdown-baseline:batch`.

### Run provenance sidecar

The `run` command writes `provenance.json` beside the backward-compatible `results.json` array.
Schema version 2 records the Xberg repository commit/dirty bit, the ordered fixture descriptors
and document BLAKE3 digests, cohort manifest identity, adapter versions and executable digests,
explicit model revision identities, timing configuration, fixed batch partitions, requested
workers, framework-specific worker semantics, and the configured Xberg thread budget.
Local absolute paths are never serialized.

Since v2.8.0, the `consolidate` command reads every `provenance.json` sidecar it finds alongside
a `results.json` (via `consolidate::load_run_provenance`) and folds it into the aggregate's
top-level `run_provenance` array — see "Migration from v2.7.0 to v2.8.0" above. A directory with
`results.json` but no `provenance.json` is recorded with `provenance: null`, not treated as an
error.

For Xberg rows, `frameworks[].configured_thread_budget` records an explicit
`--xberg-max-threads` value in either mode. For native batch rows without an explicit
value, it records the legacy `--max-concurrent` fallback passed to `xberg batch
--max-threads`. It is distinct from
`frameworks[].requested_workers`, which records the `--max-concurrent` document-concurrency
cap. `effective_workers` remains `null` because Xberg resolves effective document concurrency
from the workload. Non-Xberg rows and automatic-budget single-file rows omit
`configured_thread_budget`.

#### Run provenance migration from schema 1 to schema 2

- Added optional `FrameworkProvenance.configured_thread_budget`.
- Existing schema-1 sidecars remain readable; a missing field deserializes as `null`.
- Consumers should treat `null` as unavailable, not infer a thread budget from worker fields.
- Native-batch producers that omit `--xberg-max-threads` record the legacy fallback
  value from `--max-concurrent`; single-file producers omit the field.

### Key Format Rationale

The format component is implicit in the xberg framework name itself. Duplicating it in the
aggregate key (`xberg-markdown-baseline:markdown:single`) would be redundant and confusing.
Competitor names carry no format information, so they continue to need it in the key
(`docling:markdown:single`).

## Migration from v2.2.0 to v2.3.0

### Breaking Changes

1. **Schema version**: Bumped to `"2.3.0"`
2. **Framework key format**: Changed from `framework:mode` to `framework:output_format:mode`
3. **QualityPercentiles**: Added p95 and p99 percentiles for all F1 metrics; `f1_layout_*` fields are now optional (null for plaintext)
4. **FrameworkModeAggregation**: Added `output_format` field
5. **ComparisonData**: Replaced `pdf_tf1_ranking` with `pdf_tf1_ranking_markdown` and `pdf_tf1_ranking_plaintext`; `pdf_sf1_ranking` renamed to `pdf_sf1_ranking_markdown` (now markdown-only)

### New Fields

- `per_fixture_results`: Array of individual fixture results preserving per-file measurements
- `PerFixtureRow`: New struct capturing individual extraction outcomes

### Plaintext-only Behavior

- Plaintext frameworks NEVER appear in `pdf_sf1_ranking_markdown`
- Plaintext frameworks NEVER appear in `pdf_tf1_ranking_markdown` (they get their own `pdf_tf1_ranking_plaintext`)
- SF1 and layout percentiles are `null` for plaintext output format
- Performance rankings (`throughput_ranking`, `memory_ranking`, `cpu_seconds_ranking`,
  `pages_per_sec_ranking`) include both formats, but never pool them together: each is scored
  within its own `(output_format, mode)` segment (v2.9.0+, see `RankedFramework` above)

## ConsolidationMetadata

```json
{
  "total_results": 500,
  "framework_count": 5,
  "file_type_count": 8,
  "shared_corpus_markdown": ["pdf"],
  "shared_corpus_plaintext": ["pdf"],
  "timestamp": "2025-05-09T10:15:30Z",
  "disk_size_conflicts": [] // v2.8.0+, see "Migration from v2.7.0 to v2.8.0"
}
```

- **`framework_count`** counts *logical* frameworks: all `xberg-*` pipeline variants collapse to a
  single `xberg` before counting (so 7 competitors + xberg = 8, not 11).
- **`shared_corpus_markdown` / `shared_corpus_plaintext`** are the file types the "overall"
  `quality_ranking_markdown` / `quality_ranking_plaintext` are actually computed over — the
  intersection of file types every candidate framework of that format attempted. When a
  single-format framework (e.g. PDF-only `liteparse`/`mineru`) is in the pool, this collapses to
  that one type (e.g. `["pdf"]`), and the "overall" ranking must be read as that-type-only rather
  than a true all-format comparison.
