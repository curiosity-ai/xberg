"""Guard the per-target feature aggregates in `crates/xberg/Cargo.toml` against silent drift.

GH#1443. `windows-target` is a hand-maintained list that is supposed to carry everything
`full` does except the one capability with a real native blocker on Windows (`heic`, which
needs libheif via vcpkg). It had silently lost nine features -- `captioning`, `translation`,
`summarization-llm`, `ner-llm`, `redaction-ml`, `redaction-rehydrate`, `static-embeddings`,
`enrichment` and `otel` -- each of them a `#[cfg(feature = ...)]` gate over shipped code. Every
Windows wheel, gem and native artifact resolving through `windows-target` shipped without them.

`45bbd99088` put them back BY HAND. Nothing prevents the next hand-edit from dropping them
again: the only Windows CI job, `clippy-windows`, compiles `--features windows-target` and so
proves that the list builds, never that it is complete. `full` is exercised on Linux, and
nothing correlates the two. Adding a feature to `full` therefore silently re-opens GH#1443.
The same "keep in sync" pairs exist for `full`/`full-no-heic`, `formats`/`formats-no-heic`,
`windows-gnu-target` and `macos-intel-target`, all enforced by comment alone.

## Why "code-bearing"

A naive closure diff is useless here: it reports the aggregate NAMES (`formats`, `analysis`,
`services`) as missing from `windows-target`, because that list names their members
individually instead of the aggregate. Those names gate nothing -- grep confirms zero
`#[cfg(feature = "formats")]` (and likewise `analysis`, `services`, `full`, `full-no-heic`,
`formats-no-heic`) anywhere in `crates/xberg/src`. Excluding them by name would be an ad-hoc
patch that goes stale the moment another alias appears.

So this script compares only features that can actually cost you code: a feature is
CODE-BEARING when its own definition pulls at least one `dep:`, or its name appears in a
`#[cfg(feature = "...")]` in `crates/xberg/src`. A pure alias drops out, while every member it
forwards to is still compared -- so the rule cannot manufacture a false pass. Under it,
`full - windows-target` is exactly `{heic}`. ~keep

## What is deliberately NOT guarded

`android-target` and `no-ort-target` diverge from `full` by 23 and 39 code-bearing features
respectively, because they substitute a whole inference stack (`tract`) or drop ORT outright.
Encoding those sets would make this a change-detector -- it would fire on every legitimate
edit and get silenced -- rather than an invariant. They are listed here so their absence is a
recorded decision, not an oversight.

Exit codes: 0 = parity holds, 1 = a target lost a feature, 2 = malformed input.
